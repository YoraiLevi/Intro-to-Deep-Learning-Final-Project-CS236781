Robust Data Augmentation: The library extensively generates more training data, improving model performance.
User-friendly Interface: Fastai presents an intuitive API to ensure users can quickly build and train complex ML models.
Integration: It is highly integrable with other libraries like PyTorch (its base) for facilitating the building and training of deep learning models.

OpenCV - https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/03/machine-learning-libraries/#OpenCV
A Suite of Tools and Techniques: It provides various tools and techniques for image and video analysis, including image processing, object detection, face recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR).
Free and Open-source: OpenCV is a free and open-source library, meaning it can be used and modified by anyone without any licensing fees.
Integrable: OpenCV is easily integrated with other Python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
