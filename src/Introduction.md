# Introduction
## Project goals
Since this project is open in nature and you are free to choose your own direction and the fact that we are given repositories of already implemented models, we realize that the project goals are not as clear as in previous assignments where we were hand-held the entire process.
Further with the rapid recent advancements in the field of deep learning, we are not sure what is considered a good result and what is considered a bad result and if we could even compete with the state of the art. thus we seek some other fruitful approach to this project with which we can learn and gain from.

We have decided to focus on againing **Learning & Experience** - We want to learn and gain experience as much as possible from this project. We want to learn about the field of deep learning, about the tools and frameworks used in the field and about the process of developing a deep learning model.

Instead of focusing on success metrics we will focus on summarizing our learning and experience in this report.

# Hugging Face
Historically a frontier for everything NLP. Hugging Face is a company that has developed a framework for NLP called Transformers;
In 2022 it's no longer the case as [Hugging Face wants to be GitHub of machine learning: a look at its history, key members, and major achievements](https://www.ai.nl/artificial-intelligence/hugging-face-wants-to-be-github-of-machine-learning-a-look-at-its-history-key-members-and-major-achievements/)

- Hugging Face provides access to SOTA models for various computer vision tasks:

- Image Classification — ViT, DeiT, ConvNeXT, Swin Transformer

- Object Detection — DETR, Masked R-CNN

- Image Segmentation — MaskFormer, SETR

- Video Classification — TimeSformer, MV-ViT

- Image Generation — DALL-E 2

- Self-Supervised Models — BEiT, MAE, MaskFeat

- Vision-Language Models — VL-T5, ViLT

- Models are pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet, COCO, Kinetics,Conceptual Captions.

- OpenCV and PIL integrations allow feeding images directly to models.

- Vision pipelines provide OOTB inference for tasks like classification, object detection.

- Model repo READMEs document model architecture, training details.

- Models can be fine-tuned on new datasets using the Trainer API.

- Supports features like batched inference, mixed precision, multi-GPU training.

- Achieve leading metrics across computer vision tasks and datasets.

- Active community support for most popular vision models on Discussions forum.

Overall, Hugging Face is becoming a leading hub for transferring and deploying CV models.

<!-- The framework is open source and is used by many companies and researchers. The framework is built on top of PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. The framework is built to be easy to use and to be able to quickly prototype and experiment with different models. The framework is also built to be able to easily share models and to be able to use models that others have shared. The framework is built to be able to run on both CPU and GPU. -->
